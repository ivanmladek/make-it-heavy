# Competition Research: The Future of Inter-Agent Interaction

## Overview
This research covers a competition designed as an experiment to understand the future of inter-agent interaction by studying how artificial agents spontaneously develop languages under pressure. The insights gained could influence the design and deployment of tomorrow's multi-agent, high-level protocols.
