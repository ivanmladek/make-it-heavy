# Heterogeneous Agent Communication Research

## Research Overview
Heterogeneous agents with different architectures, capabilities, and objectives must establish effective communication without pre-defined standards. This research explores how ad-hoc protocols, task-specific languages, and evolving norms emerge during collaborative tasks.

## Key Topics for Investigation
1. **Initial Communication Establishment**
2. **Protocol Negotiation Mechanisms**
3. **Emergent Shared Vocabularies**
4. **Conflict Resolution in Objective-Conflicting Agents**
5. **Environmental Influence on Protocol Formation**
6. **Evolution of Rules and Norms**
7. **Case Studies and Real-world Applications**

## Research Questions
- How do agents with completely different architectures discover shared communication primitives?
- What role does the task environment play in facilitating protocol discovery?
- How do agents balance exploration of new communication strategies with exploitation of known protocols?
- What mechanisms prevent communication deadlocks when agents have incompatible objectives?

## Next Steps
1. Review current literature in multi-agent systems (MAS)
2. Examine protocol discovery mechanisms
3. Analyze real-world heterogeneous agent deployments
4. Identify patterns in emergent communication standards
