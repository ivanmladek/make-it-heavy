# Foundations for Emergent Language in Multi-Agent Systems

## Core Concepts
- **Emergent Communication Protocols**: How communication systems arise without centralized design
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**: Training multiple agents simultaneously
- **Referential Games**: Games where agents must develop shared meaning
- **Game Theory Applications**: Nash equilibria in communication games

## Essential Mathematical Foundations
- Information Theory (Shannon entropy, mutual information)
- Game Theory (cooperative vs competitive games)
- Reinforcement Learning basics (Q-learning, policy gradients)
- Graph Theory (network effects in agent communication)
