# The Levels of Emergent Language: A Comprehensive Research Guide

## Executive Summary

Emergent language refers to the natural progression of language development in children, moving from pre-linguistic communication to complex grammatical structures. This research document explores the systematic levels through which children acquire language, drawing from decades of developmental psychology, linguistics, and cognitive science research.

## 1. Pre-Linguistic Communication (0-12 months)

### Level 1.1: Reflexive Communication (0-2 months)
**Characteristics:**
- Reflexive crying as primary communication
- Differentiated crying patterns (hunger, discomfort, pain)
- Limited ability to respond to human voices
- Biological responses to sound and human speech

**Key Milestones:**
- Development of differentiated crying patterns
- Basic attention to human voice vs. environmental sounds
- Rooting and sucking reflexes as early communicative attempts

### Level 1.2: Cooing and Gooing Stage (2-4 months)
**Characteristics:**
- Production of vowel-like sounds ("oo", "ah")
- Pleasure vocalizations not linked to specific needs
- Beginning of turn-taking awareness
- Increased response to human interaction

**Research Insight:** Children at this stage show preference for parental voices and demonstrate early evidence of vocal turn-taking, suggesting social communication beginning.

### Level 1.3: Babbling Stage (4-8 months)
**Characteristics:**
- Consonant-vowel combinations (ba-ba, da-da, ma-ma)
- Repetitive syllable production
- Gradual expansion of sound repertoire
- Beginning of intonation patterns

**Subtypes:**
- **Marginal Babbling:** Single consonant-vowel combinations
- **Canonical Babbling:** Reduplicated babbling with repeated syllables
- **Variegated Babbling:** Different syllables combined

### Level 1.4: Jargon Stage (8-12 months)
**Characteristics:**
- Complex babbling with conversational intonation
- Sound expansion to include native language phonemes
- Non-word vocalizations that sound like sentences
- Clear social engagement in communication

## 2. First Words and Early Language (12-18 months)

### Level 2.1: Holophrastic Stage
**Characteristics:**
- Single words used to express complete thoughts
- Vocabulary of 10-50 words

### Level 2.2: Expressive Vocabulary Explosion
**Characteristics:**
- Rapid vocabulary expansion (50-100+ words by 18 months)
- Transition from referential to expressive language styles
- Beginning word combinations ("more juice", "go car")
- First evidence of grammatical categories

**Statistical Patterns:**
Research by Bates and Goodman (1997) indicates vocabulary spurt typically occurs between 16-20 months, with children acquiring 5-10 new words per day during peak periods.

## 3. Two-Word Combinations (18-24 months)

### Level 3.1: Telegraphic Speech
**Characteristics:**
- Two-word combinations ("daddy go", "big dog")
- Content words with omission of function words
- Beginning understanding of word order
- Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) of 1.5-2.0 morphemes

**Key Grammatical Relations:**
- Agent + Action ("daddy go")
- Entity + Location ("book table")
- Possessor + Possession ("mommy shoe")
- Action + Object ("eat cookie")

### Level 3.2: Multi-Word Combinations (24-30 months)
**Characteristics:**
- Progressive vocabulary expansion (200-300+ words)
- Beginning of grammatical morphemes
- Questions and negatives emerge
- MLU increasing to 2.0-2.5 morphemes

## 4. Grammatical Development (30-36 months)

### Level 4.1: Acquisition of Grammatical Morphemes
**Order of Acquisition (Brown, 1973):**
1. Progressive -ing ("daddy eating")
2. Prepositions in/on ("toy on table")
3. Plural -s ("two dogs")
4. Past tense irregular ("daddy went")
5. Possessive 's ("mommy's car")
6. Uncontractible copula ("this is mine")
7. Articles a/the ("the ball")
8. Past tense regular -ed ("played")
9. Third person present -s ("she goes")
10. Uncontractible auxiliary ("I am going")
11. Contractible copula ("that's mine")
12. Contractible auxiliary ("I'm playing")

### Level 4.2: Complex Sentences
**Characteristics:**
- Use of conjunctions (and, but, because)
- Beginning of embedded clauses
- Why, when, and how questions emerging
- First narrative structures

## 5. Advanced Grammar Development (36-48 months)

### Level 5.2: Narrative Skills
**Characteristics:**
- Simple story structure (beginning, middle, end)
- Beginning temporal sequencing
- Character and setting identification
- Cause-effect relationships recognized

## 6. Metalinguistic Awareness (48-60 months)

### Level 6.1: Language Awareness
**Characteristics:**
- Beginning understanding that language is symbolic

## Conclusion

The levels of emergent language represent a complex, multifaceted developmental process influenced by biological, environmental, social, and cultural factors. Understanding these levels provides crucial insights for parents, educators, clinicians, and policymakers working to support optimal language development. Continued research into individual differences, environmental impacts, and intervention effectiveness remains essential for addressing language disparities and ensuring all children reach their communicative potential.
