## Quantifying Competition ROI

### Standardized ROI Framework

**Economic ROI Calculation:**
```
ROI = (Total Economic Value - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost
```

**Examples:**
- **Netflix Prize**: ($1,000,000,000 - $1,000,000) / $1,000,000 = 1000:1
- **DARPA Grand Challenge**: ($100,000,000,000 - $2,000,000) / $2,000,000 = 50,000:1
- **Global Learning XPrize**: ($5,000,000,000 - $20,000,000) / $20,000,000 = 250:1

### Social Impact Multiplier Framework

**Social ROI Formula:**
```
Social ROI = (Beneficiaries × DALY Impact × Economic Value/DALY) - Investment Cost / Investment Cost
```

(Where DALY = Disability-Adjusted Life Years, standard global health metric)
