# 7-Day Intensive Preparation Plan

## Day 1-2: Core Framework Setup
- Fork the competition repository (when released)
- Set up training environment and dependencies
- Run baseline experiments with provided starter code
- Initial hyperparameter tuning

## Day 3-4: Algorithm Development
- Implement attention mechanisms for agent communication
- Test different neural architectures (RNN, Transformer, Graph Neural Networks)
- Build communication channel (message passing) system
- Test in simple 2-agent scenarios

## Day 5-6: Advanced Features
- Implement population-based training
- Add adaptive communication protocols
- Test in complex multi-agent scenarios (3-5 agents)
- Performance optimization and debugging

## Day 7: Competition Readiness
- Final testing on evaluation scenarios
- Backup system creation
- Documentation and submission preparation
- Last-minute tuning and validation
